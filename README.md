# zymo-landing-page

[landing page](https://kevin5112.github.io/zymo-landing-page/)

what I'd do with more time:
- validate the form more + have the form submitted somewhere
- store form data in a database
- add nav bar with different options to navigate to different parts of the website
- account creation
